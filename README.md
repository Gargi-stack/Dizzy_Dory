🎮 Dizzy Dory – A Flappy Fish Adventure

DIZZY DORY is a fun, underwater-themed arcade game inspired by *Flappy Bird*, built using Python and Pygame. Instead of a bird, you control a cute, dizzy little fish named Dory, trying to navigate through a maze of underwater obstacles like pipes. Your goal? Swim as far as you can without crashing!

🧠 Game Logic

The player taps the **space bar** to make Dory swim upward against gravity.
Coral-like obstacles move from right to left.
If Dory collides with a pipe or touches the screen’s top/bottom, it's **game over**.
Each time Dory successfully passes a pair of obstacles, the **score increases by 1**.
The game keeps track of the **high score** during the session.

AI Flap Suggestion Assistant

Integrates a trained Deep Q-Network model into Dizzy Dory to suggest optimal flap timings. The AI predicts actions based on fish position, velocity, and obstacle distance, displaying a visual cue (arrow) when flapping is recommended. Enhances gameplay by providing real-time, data-driven flap hints alongside manual controls.
